Overview:

Volunteers have recorded physical movement data during categorized activities. This review is extracting specific measures that are limited to mean and standard deviations of recorded activity. In order to provide baseline guidance, measures are further summarized to their average or mean by volunteer, activity and measure or variable. Follows is a definition of the steps used to prepare the data:


Source data files:

Files (UCI HAR Dataset):
	activity_labels.txt: translate activity to name: 1 WALKING
 2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
 3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS 
4 SITTING
 5 STANDING
 6 LAYING

	features.txt: list of all features 561 rows, 2 col (V1, V2). V2 provides column names in x_*.txt
		rows are var * 3 for x,y,z * 16 measures * 17 features
	features_info.txt: printed and highlighted
	readme.txt: printed and highlighted


test:
	subject_test.txt: 2947 rows (2,4,9,10,12,13,18,20,24), 1 col (V1)
	X_test.txt: test set 2947 rows, 561 cols(V1:V561)
	y_test.txt: test labels 2947 rows (1,2,3,4,5,6), 1 col (V1)
	Inertial Signals: sensor signal records

train:
	subject_train.txt: 7352 rows (1,3,5,6,7,8,11,14,15,16,17,19,21,22,23,24,25,27,28,29,30), 1 col (V1)
	X_train.txt: training set 7352 rows, 561 cols(V1:V561)
	y_train.txt: training labels 7352 rows (1,2,3,4,5,6), 1 col (V1)
	Inertial Signals: sensor signal records



Schema design:

start with
X_test + Y_test(activity key) + subject_test(volunteer) + features(column labels across x_test) + activity_labels(activity)
combine with
X_train + Y_train(activity key) + subject_train(volunteer) + features(column labels across x_train) + activity_labels(activity)

This results in a data frame of 10299 rows, 564 columns


Data choosen for analysis[working data frame column positions]: 

columns are chosen by containing means or standard deviations
naming rules are lowercase, remove non alphas, unabbreviate time and frequency, uppercase "Body" "Gravity" "Std" and "Mean"
